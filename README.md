The project "sqlalchemy-challenge" involves analyzing climate data of Honolulu, Hawaii. Using Python and SQLAlchemy, it explores precipitation and station data. Precipitation analysis involves retrieving the last 12 months' data, plotting it, and summarizing statistics. Station analysis determines the total number of stations, the most-active stations, and temperature statistics. Additionally, a Flask API is designed with routes to retrieve precipitation, station, and temperature data. Routes also handle queries for temperature statistics based on specified start and end dates. The project aims to provide insights into Honolulu's climate and facilitate easy access to relevant data through a Flask application.
